Singapore is an economic hub even though it is small in size but ut has been Southeast Asia most modern city for over a century. The city hosts people from multiple cultures & religions but not limited to Malay, Chinese, Indian and Arab etc. Due to effecient and determined government, Singapore has become a flourishing country for trade and tourism. This has created a lot of job oppurtunities in the country. Immigration to Singapore is historically the main source of population growth in the country since the founding of modern Singapore in the early 19th century. Immigration & immigration workers have been closely associated with Singapore's economic development. 

For the current capstone project "Battle of Neighbourhood", I am doing analysis for Singapore neighborhood where find the right accomodation is really tough depending upon the location & places to eat. Some places like living near to work place but with limited availability of resources. This Capstone project can help in discussing some of the below problems:

1) Finding the right accomodation for person who is moving to new location
2) Finding the right location where there are their required facilities available
3) Finding the neighbourhood near to particular attractions such as parks,galleries, specific resturants.
